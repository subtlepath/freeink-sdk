// FreeInk SDK — BLE HID host (singleton).
//
// Pairs with and connects to a Bluetooth Low Energy HID peripheral (central
// role) and exposes translated key events (printable chars + a SpecialKey enum)
// plus scan/pair/connect controls for a settings UI. One peripheral at a time.
//
// Capability-gated: the real NimBLE implementation compiles only when
// FREEINK_CAP_BLE_HID_HOST is set (and the firmware adds NimBLE-Arduino to its
// lib_deps); otherwise every method links a stub so callers need no #ifdefs and
// no BLE code is pulled in. This header is deliberately NimBLE-free so consumers
// (and host builds) never include the BLE stack just to see the API.
//
// Memory: all storage is fixed-capacity (no std::vector / heap in the hot path).
// BLE callbacks run on the NimBLE host task and hand data to the app through a
// small spinlock-guarded ring; drain it from the main loop with popKey().
//
// BLE-only — the ESP32-C3/S3 has no Bluetooth Classic radio, so Classic-only HID
// peripherals cannot connect.
