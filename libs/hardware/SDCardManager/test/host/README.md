# SD stream host tests

Run `sh libs/hardware/SDCardManager/test/host/run.sh` from the SDK root.
The runner compiles the production `SDCardManager.cpp` and public header with
host stubs for Arduino, SdFat, board configuration and the task watchdog.
No implementation is copied or extracted into the tests.

Coverage includes exact output across buffer/chunk boundaries, positive short
writes, zero-progress writes, invalid output counts, SD read errors before and
after partial output, premature EOF, zero-progress reads, short reads, 64-bit
file sizes, file closure, uninitialized/open-failure paths, watchdog subscription
and time-budgeted yields during both ordinary transfers and partial writes.
The timer rollover case checks unsigned elapsed-time arithmetic.

For host sanitizers:

```sh
CXXFLAGS='-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer' \
  sh libs/hardware/SDCardManager/test/host/run.sh
```

These tests verify transfer logic, not SD hardware or network timing. On a
device, transfer a multi-chunk file through a `Print`-derived network client and
compare its size and hash with the SD original. Then interrupt the connection
and check that the helper reports failure without restarting the device.
